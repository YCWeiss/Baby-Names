# Baby-Names

This project explores the popularity of baby names over time.
I was guided in this project by Michele Vallisneri in his course "Python Data Analysis." 
The data used in this project comes from the Social Security name data set.    
I used python to analyze the the data in order to gain insights into different name trends for both male and female names. 
I hope you enjoy looking through this project as much as I enjoyed working on it!
